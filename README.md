<div style="text-align: right">GCP-searxngSearx is a free and open-source metasearch engine. It aggregates results from more than 70 search engines and allows users to search the web anonymously. It is written in Python and is designed to be lightweight and easily extensible. Users can customize their search experience by selecting different search engines, themes, and other settings. Searx can also be self-hosted, which means that you can run your own instance of the search engine on your own server. This gives you more control over your data and privacy.</div>
